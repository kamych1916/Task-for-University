# Task for University - Basketball Match


I'm using Flask web-framework in back-end, and Vue/Vuetify in front-end

Database - sqlite3

For creating database and manipulate him, we using ORM - peewee 

If you wnat to learn about this project, you can open file with name "explanatory.docx", and if you want to see presentation, just open file with name "presentation.pptx"

The client side was not properly designed, because I did not have much time.
